Then don't use src directory and turbopack, else do yes for everything
Now in the video tailwind.config.ts file is present is their project but in mine it is not, so create the file and write the code there

Do npm i next-themes in client, Important for implementing dark and light mode

Come to app/page.tsx and remove all things and write our own code

We need some helper components so create utils folder under app

create Heading.tsx in utils folder to keep the metadata 
Now come to app/page.tsx and render Heading component by passing props title,description,keywords

Update global.css in app : write hero-animation and keyframes

Create theme-provider.tsx in utils

Update layout.tsx in app


Update Header.tsx in components 
Create NavItems,tsx in utils folder

Create ThemeSwitcher.tsx in utils

NOTE: For named export like export const Fn() we need to import in curly braces like import {Fn} from ..., but for default export like 
const Fn=()=>{
    //code
}
export default Fn;
For above type we can import without curly braces

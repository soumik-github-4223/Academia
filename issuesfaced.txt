Creating Dark light mode : not solved

verification part where redux rtt query is used

problems came because of conflicting versions of react and mateial ui modules.. like a functionality seen in YT and this is not supported anymore. This created a lot of problem to resolve
Solved this by downrgading the versions and making it compatiable for all package. Did this by updating package.json and then installing node modules again

While unwrapping params got from url body we need to use 'use' in newer next js version otherwise it'll give error, copilot helped me to solve this issue quickly

After login with email password, after each refresh automatically I am getting logged out

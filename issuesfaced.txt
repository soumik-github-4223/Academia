Creating Dark light mode : not solved

verification part where redux rtt query is used

problems came because of conflicting versions of react and mateial ui modules.. like a functionality seen in YT and this is not supported anymore. This created a lot of problem to resolve
Solved this by downrgading the versions and making it compatiable for all package. Did this by updating package.json and then installing node modules again
